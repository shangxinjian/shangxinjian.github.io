<p>大家好，我是商新建。我在山东东营，我刚开始学习编程，是个纯新手，来这里向大神们请教，和大家一起学习编程。</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>我是谁？</h3>

<p>我大学学的是给水排水工程专业，硕士研究生读的市政工程专业，在编程方面，我的最大优势可能是我本科还取得了英语专业文学学士学位。在我看来，大家都可以学习编程，坚韧不拔的，持之以恒的坚持下去，用不了多久，我们都能做的很好。一起加油！</p>

<h1>How to Ask Questions the Smart Way</h1>
<h6>Eric Steven Raymond</h6>

  <h2>When You Ask</h2>
  <h3>Choose your forum carefully</h3>
    <p>Be sensitive in choosing where you ask your question. You are likely to be ignored, or written off as a loser, if you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>post your question to a forum where it's off topic</li>
      <li>post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa</li>
      <li>cross-post to too many different newsgroups</li>
      <li>post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hackers blow off questions that are inappropriately targeted in order to try to protect their communications channels from being drowned in irrelevance. You don't want this happen to you.</p>

    <p>The first step, therefore, is to find the right forum. Again, Google and other Web-searching methods are your friend. Use them to find the project webpage most closely associated with the hardware or software giving you difficulties. Usually it will have links to a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) list, and to project mailing lists and their archives. These mailing lists are the final places to go for help, if your own efforts (including reading those FAQs you found) do not find you a solution. The project page may also describe a bug reporting procedure, or have a link to one; if so, follow it.</p>

    <p>Shooting off an e-mail ot a person or forum which you are not familiar with is risky at best. For example, do not assume that the author of an informative webpage wants to be your free consultant. Do not make optimistic guesses about whether your question will be welcome - if you're unsure, send it elsewhere, or refrain from sending it at all.</p>

    <p>When selecting a Web forum, newsgroup or mailing list, don't trust the name by itself too far; look for a FAQ or charter to verify your question is on topic.Read some of the back traffic before posting so you'll get a feel for how things are done there. In fact, it's a very good idea to do a keyword search for words relating to your problem on the newsgroup or mailing list archives before you post. It may find you an answer, and if not it will help you formulate a better question.</p>

    <p>Don't shotgun-blast all the available help channels at once, that's like yelling and irritates people. Step through them softly.</p>

    <p>Know what your topic is! One of the classic mistakes is asking questions about hte Unix or Windows programming interface in a forum devoted to a language or library or tool portable across both. If you don't understand why this is a blunder, you'd be best off not asking any questions at all until you get it.</p>

    <p>In general, questions to a well-selected public forum are more likely to get useful answers than equivalent questions to a private one. There are multiple reasons for this. One is simply the size of the pool of petential respondents. Another is the size of the audience; hackers would rather answer questions that educate many people than questions serving only a few.</p>

    <p>Understandably, skilled hackers and authors of popular software are already receiving more than their fair share of mis-targeted messages. By adding to the flood, you could in extreme cases even be the straw that breaks the camel's back - quite afew times, contributors to popular projects have withdrawn their support because collateral damage in the form of useless e-mail traffic to their personal accounts became unbearable.</p>

  <h2>Stack Overflow</h2>
  <h3>Search, then ask on Stack Exchange</h3>
    <p>In recent years, the Stack Exchange community of sites has emerged as a major resource for answering technical and other questions and is even the preferred forum for many open-source projects.</p>
